Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - A Structured Approach to Software Creation

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process followed by software developers to create high-quality software efficiently. It provides a structured approach, ensuring that software is developed in a planned, organized, and cost-effective manner. The SDLC consists of various stages, each crucial to delivering a robust and functional software product.

Stages of SDLC:
Planning: The planning phase is the foundation of the SDLC. Here, the project’s objectives, scope, and feasibility are determined. Key stakeholders, including business analysts, project managers, and technical leads, collaborate to define the system requirements and resources needed. This phase sets the stage for the entire development process, identifying risks and setting timelines.

Requirements Gathering and Analysis: In this stage, developers work closely with clients or end-users to gather detailed functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements outline what the software is supposed to do and its expected performance. This phase is crucial as it helps prevent scope creep and ensures that the development aligns with the stakeholders' expectations.

Design: The design phase translates the requirements into a blueprint for the software. It involves creating system architecture, defining data models, choosing the appropriate technology stack, and planning the system’s interface. This phase is divided into:

High-Level Design (HLD): Defines the system architecture and outlines the overall solution.
Low-Level Design (LLD): Focuses on the detailed design of modules, components, and data structures.
Development (Coding): During development, programmers write the code based on the design specifications. This is the phase where the actual software is built using selected programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. The development team ensures that the code is modular, maintainable, and adheres to coding standards.

Testing: After the software is developed, it goes through rigorous testing to identify and fix any defects. The testing phase ensures that the software functions as intended and meets the specified requirements. Different types of testing are conducted, including:

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules.
Integration Testing: Verifying that different modules work together.
System Testing: Testing the complete system as a whole.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Ensuring that the software meets end-user requirements.
Deployment: Once the software passes the testing phase, it is deployed to a production environment. This phase involves releasing the software to end-users. Depending on the project, deployment may occur in stages (e.g., beta releases, phased rollouts) to ensure smooth implementation.

Maintenance: The SDLC doesn’t end with deployment. Post-launch, the software enters the maintenance phase, where developers address bugs, add new features, and make improvements based on user feedback. Regular updates and patches ensure the software continues to function efficiently and securely over time.

Models of SDLC:
Different projects may follow various SDLC models, depending on the complexity, timeline, and flexibility required. Common SDLC models include:
