## Branching Strategy
- Each member creates a personal branch named STUDENTID-Name (e.g., 101422675-Abhishek).
- Main Branch: The main branch contains the stable, production-ready code.
- All changes are merged into the main branch via Pull Requests (PRs) after review to ensure code quality and consistency.

This approach helps maintain organization and promotes effective collaboration among team members.
